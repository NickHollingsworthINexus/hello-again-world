*Lets go round the loop again*

I editted this in the readme-edits branch.

I am looking for a way to list all unmerged branches and for each to see some facts.

I want to see:

 * all our branches
 * how long since they last pushed to integration
 * the amount of uncommited change in them
 * how long since they last pulled changes in from integration

OtherREADME is for dull stuff and README is for the best stuff!
